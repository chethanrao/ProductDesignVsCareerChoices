As per christensen's book on how will you measure your life?
One needs to choose motivating factors over hygeine factors
Can same principles be applied to creation of a product?
If a product is created such that it would solve a harder problem with less revenue outcomes be  better than solving a easier
problem with more revenue outcomes? Sacrificing the immediate gains of the product will be better for the future of the product? or would better user experience would pay more even though one needs to spend money at this point of time?
Question is how much cash you can burn? like honda vs harley davidson one could pursue a emergent strategy until a perfect fitting occurs...
One could also see how honda succeeded while iridium failed. Honda was so financially constrained that Honda optimized for profits rather than growth initially whereas motorola failed with the iridium strategy because it optimised initially for growth before finding a profitable way to make money.Successful companies don't succeed because they have right strategy at
the begining but rather they have money left over after the original strategy fails. You can imagine this like a side 
of a rectangle that got bigger before its breadth got increased as a result the area of the rectangle
that is the cash burn increased due to the wrong idea. Every idea needs to be unit tested with proper data before 
moving it into production.Lot of these apply to one's life as well. Is it easier to change one's behaviour when the person
is a child or when a person is an adult? children need to be given more attention when they are small so that they can
create positive impact to the world when they become adults.Parents need to be at the right place at right time to make the
right positive impact.
Many companies including dell have pursued the strategy of outsourcing as a part of short term solutions to increase profits without considering long term implications. Now companies likes asus learnt the business and are able to offer all the 
outsourced products from bottom to top.Hardware business is generally like commodity business. Generally commodity business has low margins and need to have huge volumes to make profits. Clearly suppliers in south east asia have cost advantage due to low labour costs(which is though currently increasing slowly).Many suppliers in Taiwan,Korea,Singapore and china have developed capabilities to make products from american customers.
The core capabilities to succeed in the future should not be shared with the suppliers or outsourcing companies.
