As per christensen's book on how will you measure your life?
One needs to choose motivating factors over hygeine factors
Can same principles be applied to creation of a product?
If a product is created such that it would solve a harder problem with less revenue outcomes be  better than solving a easier
problem with more revenue outcomes? Sacrificing the immediate gains of the product will be better for the future of the product? or would better user experience would pay more even though one needs to spend money at this point of time?
Question is how much cash you can burn? like honda vs harley davidson one could pursue a emergent strategy until a perfect fitting occurs...
One could also see how honda succeeded while iridium failed. Honda was so financially constrained that Honda optimized for profits rather than growth initially whereas motorola failed with the iridium strategy because it optimised initially for growth before finding a profitable way to make money.
Though in today's world we can see lot of businesses are burning cash even in the first few years example uber. It is important to demonstrate a profitable model to the investors and drive the growth when investors have enough confidence
in the business model that it can do the desired job.
