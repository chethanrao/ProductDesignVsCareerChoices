As per christensen's book on how will you measure your life?
One needs to choose motivating factors over hygeine factors
Can same principles be applied to creation of a product?
If a product is created such that it would solve a harder problem with less revenue outcomes be  better than solving a easier
problem with more revenue outcomes? Sacrificing the immediate gains of the product will be better for the future of the product? or would better user experience would pay more even though one needs to spend money at this point of time?
Question is how much cash you can burn? like honda vs harley davidson one could pursue a emergent strategy until a perfect fitting occurs...
One could also see how honda succeeded while iridium failed. Honda was so financially constrained that Honda optimized for profits rather than growth initially whereas motorola failed with the iridium strategy because it optimised initially for growth before finding a profitable way to make money.Successful companies don't succeed because they have right strategy at
the begining but rather they have money left over after the original strategy fails. You can imagine this like a side 
of a rectangle that got bigger before its breadth got increased as a result the area of the rectangle
that is the cash burn increased due to the wrong idea.
